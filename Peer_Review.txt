Peer’s project: Akane's Branching Plot Novel

 

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer’s project?
The file types have to be recognizable by the pygame library, because pygame will ignore it even if it's named correctly (example - .shrine isn't a file type it recognizes, but .json is)
 

What is something you saw in your peer’s project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
The depth of involvement in making the story for the game. I tend to only try a couple of things and then stop near the bare minimum. The amoun that was added to the story was phenomenal.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Checking the spelling for each new line of code written to make sure it's consistent throughout. 
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
adding comments to trickier sections can help you remember what's supposed to be happening and better troubleshoot when it isn't (ex - added comment for the check_quit)
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
in the text, there were spots that included \n\ or similar parts, which I believe were supposed to make it appear on a new line...but they were throwing errors and I got it to work by removing them.

 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Don't forget to customize the readme to talk about what you're specifically trying to accomplish with the game and what you did to do so!

 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Excellent storywriting and great depth in the amount of options that you gave the player!
